## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete this section on my own, and did not need to consult the solutions. The exercise was overall helpful, especially the table one. I hoped that the form would have a bit more information. An exercise focussing on using the different html objects would be helpful.

### Accessibility

I was able to do this exercise just using the notes from class, without needing to consult the solutions. There was only one exercise, but I found it useful. I would like an accessibility exercise that covers more accessibility issues than just labels, but it was a good starting intro.

### CSS

I had a lot of issues with this one, I still didn't get the positioning quite right. But the media one was good, and the selectors was very useful. I wish there had been a css exercise for navbars specifically.

### FlexBox

I was able to mostly complete these. Some minor differences between the images, but the setup matched. I had a lot of difficulty dealing with the different justification options, but the directions for wrap directions were good.

### Grid

I love grid so much more than flex. It makes sense, its neat and orderly. I was able to finish the exercises the easiest of any of them so far. 

### Bootstrap
